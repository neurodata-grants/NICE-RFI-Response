SYNOPSIS
Neurally Inspired Computing Principles


The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is seeking information on neurally-inspired computing principles. This request for information (RFI) is issued solely for information gathering purposes; the RFI does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals. IARPA anticipates that responses to this RFI will be used to help organize a workshop on this topic at the 2016 Neuro Inspired Computational Elements conference (http://niceworkshop.org/) and to inform future programs in this technical area. The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.


BACKGROUND AND SCOPE
Seventy years ago, John von Neumann found inspiration for the design of the EDVAC in what was then known about the design of the brain. However, despite the early influence of neuroscience on what has become known as the von Neumann architecture, the principles of computing underlying today's state of the art digital systems deviate substantially from the principles that govern computing in the brain. In particular, whereas mainstream computers rely on synchronous operations, high precision, and clear physical and conceptual separations between storage, data, and logic; the brain relies on asynchronous messaging, low precision storage that is co-localized with processing, and dynamic memory structures that change on both short and long time scales. To understand the potential opportunities and challenges in developing next-generation computers that exploit these and other principles of neural computing, IARPA is seeking information from two groups of experts: (1) computer scientists with experience in designing or building computing systems that rely on the same or similar principles as those employed by the brain; and (2) neuroscientists who have credible ideas for how neural computing principles can offer practical benefits for next-generation computers.
Responses to this RFI should clearly and concisely answer the questions posed below (to neuroscientists, computer scientists, or both) in one or more of the following topics:


Topic 1: Spike-based representations:


Brains operate using spike-based codes that often appear sparse in time and across populations of neurons. In many systems, these codes appear noisy or imprecise, suggesting a plausible role for approximate computation in brain function.


For neuroscientists:
•	What practical benefits could our current understanding of the brain's use of spike-based representations, sparse coding, and/or approximate computation offer for next-generation computers? What gaps in understanding or challenges must first be overcome?
•	Have there been simulations or demonstrations of how spike-based representations, sparse coding, and/or approximate computation can be used to perform real-world tasks?


For computer scientists:
•	What is the current state of research in the use of spike-based representations, sparse coding, and/or approximate computations for digital or analog computing systems? 
•	Are there existing hardware systems that utilize representations similar to spikes? If so, in which application areas and use cases have these been deployed, and what are their performance characteristics?


 


Topic 2: Asynchronous computation:


Brains do not employ a global clock signal to synchronously update all computing elements at once. Instead, neurons function independently by default, and only transiently coordinate their activity (e.g. when participating in a coherent cell assembly).


For neuroscientists:
•	What practical benefits could our current understanding of the brain's use of asynchronous computation and/or transient coordination offer for next-generation computers? What gaps in understanding or challenges must first be overcome?
•	Have there been simulations or demonstrations of how asynchronous computation and/or transient coordination can be used to perform real-world tasks?


For computer scientists:
•	What is the current state of research in the use of asynchronous computation and/or transient coordination for digital or analog computing systems? 
•	Are there existing hardware systems that utilize asynchronous computation and/or transient coordination? If so, in which application areas and use cases have these been deployed, and what are their performance characteristics?


 


Topic 3: Learning:


Brains employ plasticity mechanisms that operate continuously and over multiple time scales to support online learning. Remarkably, brains continue to operate stably during ongoing plasticity.


For neuroscientists:
•	What practical benefits could our current understanding of the brain's use of online learning over short and long time scales offer for next-generation computers? What gaps in understanding or challenges must first be overcome?
•	Have there been simulations or demonstrations of how online learning over short and long time scales can be used to perform real-world tasks?


For computer scientists:
•	What is the current state of research in the use of online learning over short and long time scales for digital or analog systems? 
•	Are there existing hardware systems that utilize online learning over short and long time scales? If so, in which application areas and use cases have these been deployed, and what are their performance characteristics?


 


Topic 4: Co-local memory storage and computation:


Brains do not strictly segregate memory and computing elements, as in the traditional von Neumann architecture. Rather, the synaptic inputs to a neuron can serve the dual role of storing memories and supporting computation.


For neuroscientists:
•	What practical benefits could our current understanding of the brain's use of co-local memory storage and computation offer for next-generation computers? What gaps in understanding or challenges must first be overcome?
•	Have there been simulations or demonstrations of how co-local memory storage and computation can be used to perform real-world tasks?


For computer scientists:
•	What is the current state of research in the use of co-local memory storage and computation for digital or analog computing systems? 
•	Are there existing hardware systems that utilize co-local memory storage and computation? If so, in which application areas and use cases have these been deployed, and what are their performance characteristics?
